# Birthday Calculator

The Birthday Calculator is a simple Python application that calculates your age based on your birth date.

## How it works

The application prompts the user to input their birth year, month, and day. It then calculates the user's age by subtracting the birth date from the current date.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `main.py` in your Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to input your birth year, month, and day.

## Limitations

- The application does not account for leap years when calculating age.
- The application assumes that all months have 31 days, except for February which is assumed to have 28 days.

## Future Improvements

- Account for leap years in age calculation.
- Correctly handle different month lengths.
